          <h1>Feeding The Beast
		  <br>An Obsession with Learning</h1>

<p>The "Beast" is a personal obsession with learning highly structures systems. Like Mathmatics and Programming. And Science Journal Articles. And Other Stuff. None of it especially useful? but keeping myself stimulated is worth something! </p>

		<h3>SLAM-seq defines direct gene-regulatory functions of the BRD4-MYC axis</h3>    
		<h4>Transcription Factors</h4>
		<p>Transcription Factors (and Chromatin Regulators):
		    <ul>
		        <li>When normally regulated:
			    <ul><li>govern the identity and fate of a cell</ul>
			<li>when mutated or dysregulated:
				<ul><li>drives cancer and other diseases</ul>
		    </ul>
		</p>
		<h4>Epigenetic Regulators</h4>    
		<h5>Epigenetic means:</h5>
		    <p><ul>
			<li>heritable change in gene function that does not involve changes in DNA sequence
		        <li> where epi means "in addition to" in Greek
		        <li>and the effects are most often changes in the chromosome
		        <li>but would include prions too
		        <li>the changes must be inheritable, either in the progeny of the cells or organism
		        </ul>
		    </p>
		    <h5>Types of Epigenetic Regulators</h5>
		    <p>
		        <ul>
			    <li>Regulators that support normal cell function
			    <li>Regulators that somehow maintain aberrant states
			        <ul>
				    <li>!!!!Accessible Entry Points for Targeted Therapy!!!!
				</ul>
		        </ul>
		    </p>
		    <h5>Therapy Targeted on "Aberrant" Epigenetic Regulators</h5> 
	            <h6>Example:BET bromodomain inhibitors (a.k.a. BETis )</h6>
		    <p>
		        <ul>
			    <li>Theraputic activity in leukemia (and other cancer) models
			    <li>... but with poorly understood mechanisms
			</ul>

		<h2>Today I Review My Vim Editor Basics</h2>

		<h3>The Vim Help Files</h3>
		<h4>The User Manual</h4>
		<p><a href="https://www.vim.org"> The Vim Editor Web Site</a> refers to the HTML version of the <a href="https://www.vimhelp.appspot.com">Vim help pages</a>. We find that the "Vim Documentation" consists of two parts, "The User Manual" and "The Reference Manual".  The User Manual has task oriented explanations, from simple to complex. So that seems like a good way to proceed for now.</p>
		<p>So to my credit, I do regularily use some of the "basics":
		    <ul>
			<li>"Move Around"
			<li>"Insert"
			<li>"Get Out of Vim"
			<li>"Quit" (Discard Changes and Quit)
			<li>"Write File and Quit"
			<li>"Deleting Characters"
			<li>"Enter Command Line Mode"
		    </ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		    <h4>VimRC: Setting up a simple .vimrc file</h4>
		        <p>You can do this "inside" vim</p>
			<p>:!cp -i $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim ~/.vimrc</p>
		    <h4>Vi-Compatability "Switched Off"</h4>
		        <p>Vim manuals often assume you are using Vim with the Vi-compatibility switched "off". To check the Vi-compatibility status, use:<br>:set compatibility?</p>
			<p>If it responds with "nocompatible" it is set correctly. Apparently thre new .vimrc set it correctly.  I really should look to see what I put into my vim set up!</p>
		</p>
		<p>
		    <h4>Vim Things I Knew Once, But have Forgotten</h4>
		    <ul>
			<li>Delete a Line with the "dd" command
			<li>Join two lines together with the "J" command (a.k.a. Delete A Line Break)
			<li>Undo the last edit with command "u"
			<li>Redo with the CTRL-R command
			<li>Append with "a" command (Similar to "i" command)
			<li>Open a New Line with "o" command (also "O" command)
		    </ul>

		<p>I lie to find systems that are complex ("non-trivial") and develop ("subscribe") to a program of learning more about them, with "Mastery" being the goal.</p>

			<h3>Background for the story of "The Magic of Toxin B and Its Recognition of Frizzled Proteins"</h3>
			<p>The Toxin B Protein of Clostridium difficile is a model protein recognition system. It targets colonic epithelia by binding to the "frizzled" FZD family of Wnt receptors. Anyhow, before I can get into the cool stuff regarding this protein recognition mechanism, I thought id brush up a little on what Clostridium difficile is</p>

		<div class="body">
			<h3>Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
			    <ul><li>is a common complication of diabetes
				<li>the leading cause of blindness in U.S. adults
				<li>can be detected by analysing a patient's retina
			    </ul> </p>
			    <h3>Mechanism of Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
			    <ul><li>in the eye, tiny blood vessels leak, making the retina swell
			        <li>when the macula swells, it is called macular edema
					<ul><li>"The macula is the central area of the retina and is of particular interest to retina specialists. Remember, that the retina is the light sensitive tissue which lines the inside of the eye. The macula is the functional center of the retina. It gives us the ability to see “20/20” and provides the best color vision." <a href="https://www.vmrinstitute.com/what-is-the-macula/">VMR Institute</a>
							<li>Edema is swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in your body's tissues. </ul>
					<li> This is the most common reason why people with diabetes lose their vision</ul>
			   </p>
			   <h3>Exciting New Retinopathy Screening System</h3>
			    <ul><li>Artifical Intelligence based disease screening software
			        <li>first AI screening software approved by FDA
				<li>requires a special retinal camera
					<li>Accuracy<ul>
						<li>87.4% of patients with the disease
						<li>89.5% of patients without the disease
							<li>positives then referred to eye specialist
						</ul>
			    </ul></p>
			    <h3>The Cool Thing</h3>
			    <p>"If widely adopted, the software could make it easier for more patients to get regularly screened for the condition"</p>
