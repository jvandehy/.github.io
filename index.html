          <h1>Feeding The Beast
		  <br>An Obsession with Learning</h1>

<p>The "Beast" is a personal obsession with learning highly structures systems. Like Mathmatics and Programming. And Science Journal Articles. And Other Stuff. None of it especially useful? but keeping myself stimulated is worth something! </p>

			<h3>Background for the story of "The Magic of Toxin B and Its Recognition of Frizzled Proteins"</h3>
			<p>The Toxin B Protein of Clostridium difficile is a model protein recognition system. It targets colonic epithelia by binding to the "frizzled" FZD family of Wnt receptors. Anyhow, before I can get into the cool stuff regarding this protein recognition mechanism, I thought id brush up a little on what Clostridium difficile is</p>

			<h3>Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
			    <ul><li>is a common complication of diabetes
				<li>the leading cause of blindness in U.S. adults
				<li>can be detected by analysing a patient's retina
			    </ul> </p>
			    <h3>Mechanism of Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
			    <ul><li>in the eye, tiny blood vessels leak, making the retina swell
			        <li>when the macula swells, it is called macular edema
					<ul><li>"The macula is the central area of the retina and is of particular interest to retina specialists. Remember, that the retina is the light sensitive tissue which lines the inside of the eye. The macula is the functional center of the retina. It gives us the ability to see “20/20” and provides the best color vision." <a href="https://www.vmrinstitute.com/what-is-the-macula/">VMR Institute</a>
							<li>Edema is swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in your body's tissues. </ul>
					<li> This is the most common reason why people with diabetes lose their vision</ul>
			   </p>
			   <h3>Exciting New Retinopathy Screening System</h3>
			    <ul><li>Artifical Intelligence based disease screening software
			        <li>first AI screening software approved by FDA
				<li>requires a special retinal camera
					<li>Accuracy<ul>
						<li>87.4% of patients with the disease
						<li>89.5% of patients without the disease
							<li>positives then referred to eye specialist
						</ul>
			    </ul></p>
			    <h3>The Cool Thing</h3>
			    <p>"If widely adopted, the software could make it easier for more patients to get regularly screened for the condition"</p>
