		  <br>An Obsession with Learning</h1>

<p>The "Beast" is a personal obsession with learning highly structures systems. Like Mathmatics and Programming. And Science Journal Articles. And Other Stuff. None of it especially useful? but keeping myself stimulated is worth something! </p>

		<h3 class="subtitle">Reflections on Life</h3>
		<div class="body">              
		<p>The "Big Move" is a couple of related things.  One one level its moving Zeke to his college.  Its also maybe the begining of a new life for me.  (I think its a mid-life crisis, but that may be very optimistic!).  I feel like everything in my life is pushing me to embrace a beam of growth and fullfillment.  Where does this come from? I can't answer fully. Right now the factors are that I feel incredibly strong intellectually now. I am just gobbleing up Science articles and "economist" articles and novels and economics ("Crash") and technical stuff ("CSS in Depth") and Haskell and "Lambda Calculus" and putting lost of good work into our Company "Reporting System" with it's complicated google sheets formulas and advanced MBA insights.  I feel strong and excited about the "juggernaut" work outs I have been doing.</p>
		<p>This little colection of articles is also part of my "Big Move".  I am so pleased with the fact that I learned how to publish a real web site.  I am posting my thoughts and my pictures and have such "big"plans.</p>
		<p>I am so excited.  A place to put my thoughts.  A record of my learning.  I think its scary and satisfying to recognize "The Beast" I need to keep learning or I feel sad/depressed. But what is easier than learning new things? I will someday think of a better word, but right now I am comfortable calling this demand for new ideas a type of Beast.</p>
		<p>The big move also addresses an important change in my life.  I am sobbing as I write this, but for the first time since I brought Ben home as a new born, None of my boys are physically with me at our home. I will have to write more about this later, but it is a change, a necessary change, but its not easy.     </p>
		<p>What I envision is that this modest set of "Today I Learned"s to become a lot of diverse writing.  Maybe journal entries on TILs, but also reflections and ideas, and notes on where i am and how i'm doing. Note to self:  This dog is demanding, but a true comfort too "Wheres my Bojo, oh time for Loves"     </p>

		<h3>Reflections on some poor skills</h3>
		<div class="body"><p> The truth is that I am a slow typist. I am a poor editor. Its so bad that it takes me too long to write and post blogs as often as I would like. I guess its better than not having any good ideas to write about! Oh, and I suck at spelling too. I just had all these thoughts in the shower.  </p>
		<p>So what to do about it? Probably the first thing is to get better at keyboarding.  I know I have never been fast, but now I don't think I can type without looking at my hands. It seems like if I am writing a lot, I should just naturally get better, right. (As I look at my hands as I type this!). And editing - to me this means just getting better at using VIM. Again, that seems like something you could pick up a little at a time and to be honest, I am learning to cut and paste a little!  And grabbing pictures from Flickr is getting a little more routine.</p>
		<p>So I guess I need to "play with Vim some more and turn out the lights when I am typing! I just found an online <a href="https://www.catswhocode.com/blog/vim-cheat-sheet-for-2016">Vim Cheat Sheet</a>.Here are a few more basics to incorporate:</p>
		<p><ul>
			<li>e	move the cursor to the end of the word
			<li>b	move the cursor to the begining of the word
			<li>0	move the cursor to the begining of the line
			<li>G	move the cursor to the end of the file
			<li>gg	move the cursor to the begining of the file
			<li>L	move the cursor to the bottom of the screen

		<h3>What is Mica anyhow?</h3>
		<div class="body">
		<p>Today we explored the sort of south-western part of North Carolina. We are staying in a "cabin" near Marion, North Carolina.  Today we drove to Lindell Falls, then south on the Blue Ridge Parkway. We took lots of pictures and met some interesting people, including Mike and 
		Dawn, I think. Mike is an amateur photographer, and has an Instagram presence at sonderCLT, I think. He took our picture, so hopefully he will post it. We also went to the Museum of North Carolina Minerals.  </p>	
		<p>Which brings me to my "Today I Learned". The museum said they mined, amoung other things, "mica" and "quartz".  We I thought what is Mica, and why is it mined?  Answer Mica has tons of Aluminium!</p>   
		<p>
		Chemically, micas can be given the general formula: X2Y4–6Z8O20(OH, F)4,in which
		<ul>
			<li>X is K, Na, or Ca or less commonly Ba, Rb, or Cs;
			<li>Y is Al, Mg, or Fe or less commonly Mn, Cr, Ti, Li, etc.;
			<li>Z is chiefly Si or Al, but also may include Fe3+ or Ti. </p>
		</ul>
		<img  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Mica_%286911818878%29.jpg/260px-Mica_%286911818878%29.jpg" alt = "pictue of mica from wikipedia">
		</p>
		<p> And why is quartz mined?  Its the source for silica for computer chips!</p>

		<h3>SLAM-seq defines direct gene-regulatory functions of the BRD4-MYC axis</h3>    
		<h4>Transcription Factors</h4>
		<p>Transcription Factors (and Chromatin Regulators):
		    <ul>
		        <li>When normally regulated:
			    <ul><li>govern the identity and fate of a cell</ul>
			<li>when mutated or dysregulated:
				<ul><li>drives cancer and other diseases</ul>
		    </ul>
		</p>
		<h4>Epigenetic Regulators</h4>    
		<h5>Epigenetic means:</h5>
		    <p><ul>
			<li>heritable change in gene function that does not involve changes in DNA sequence
		        <li> where epi means "in addition to" in Greek
		        <li>and the effects are most often changes in the chromosome
		        <li>but would include prions too
		        <li>the changes must be inheritable, either in the progeny of the cells or organism
		        </ul>
		    </p>
		    <h5>Types of Epigenetic Regulators</h5>
		    <p>
		        <ul>
			    <li>Regulators that support normal cell function
			    <li>Regulators that somehow maintain aberrant states
			        <ul>
				    <li>!!!!Accessible Entry Points for Targeted Therapy!!!!
				</ul>
		        </ul>

		    <h5>Therapy Targeted on "Aberrant" Epigenetic Regulators</h5> 
	            <h6>Example:BET bromodomain inhibitors (a.k.a. BETis )</h6>

		<h3>The Vim Help Files</h3>
		<h4>The User Manual</h4>
		<p><a href="https://www.vim.org"> The Vim Editor Web Site</a> refers to the HTML version of the <a href="https://www.vimhelp.appspot.com">Vim help pages</a>. We find that the "Vim Documentation" consists of two parts, "The User Manual" and "The Reference Manual".  The User Manual has task oriented explanations, from simple to complex. So that seems like a good way to proceed for now.</p>
		<p>So to my credit, I do regularily use some of the "basics":
		    <ul>
			<li>"Move Around"
			<li>"Insert"
			<li>"Get Out of Vim"
			<li>"Quit" (Discard Changes and Quit)
			<li>"Write File and Quit"
			<li>"Deleting Characters"
			<li>"Enter Command Line Mode"
		    </ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		    <h4>VimRC: Setting up a simple .vimrc file</h4>
		        <p>You can do this "inside" vim</p>
			<p>:!cp -i $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim ~/.vimrc</p>
		    <h4>Vi-Compatability "Switched Off"</h4>
		        <p>Vim manuals often assume you are using Vim with the Vi-compatibility switched "off". To check the Vi-compatibility status, use:<br>:set compatibility?</p>
			<p>If it responds with "nocompatible" it is set correctly. Apparently thre new .vimrc set it correctly.  I really should look to see what I put into my vim set up!</p>
		</p>
		<p>
		    <h4>Vim Things I Knew Once, But have Forgotten</h4>
		    <ul>
			<li>Delete a Line with the "dd" command
			<li>Join two lines together with the "J" command (a.k.a. Delete A Line Break)
			<li>Undo the last edit with command "u"
			<li>Redo with the CTRL-R command
			<li>Append with "a" command (Similar to "i" command)
			<li>Open a New Line with "o" command (also "O" command)
		    </ul>

		<div class="body">
			<h3>Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
			    <ul><li>is a common complication of diabetes
				<li>the leading cause of blindness in U.S. adults
				<li>can be detected by analysing a patient's retina
			    </ul> </p>
			    <h3>Mechanism of Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
			    <ul><li>in the eye, tiny blood vessels leak, making the retina swell
			        <li>when the macula swells, it is called macular edema
					<ul><li>"The macula is the central area of the retina and is of particular interest to retina specialists. Remember, that the retina is the light sensitive tissue which lines the inside of the eye. The macula is the functional center of the retina. It gives us the ability to see “20/20” and provides the best color vision." <a href="https://www.vmrinstitute.com/what-is-the-macula/">VMR Institute</a>
							<li>Edema is swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in your body's tissues. </ul>
					<li> This is the most common reason why people with diabetes lose their vision</ul>
			   </p>
			   <h3>Exciting New Retinopathy Screening System</h3>
			    <ul><li>Artifical Intelligence based disease screening software
			        <li>first AI screening software approved by FDA
				<li>requires a special retinal camera
					<li>Accuracy<ul>
						<li>87.4% of patients with the disease
						<li>89.5% of patients without the disease
							<li>positives then referred to eye specialist
						</ul>
			    </ul></p>
			    <h3>The Cool Thing</h3>
			    <p>"If widely adopted, the software could make it easier for more patients to get regularly screened for the condition"</p>
